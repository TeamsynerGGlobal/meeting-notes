## Updates

1. Survey tool development progress for demo with Audrey
    - Drag and drop functionality almost complete with testing underway
    - Storyboard preparation on track for today’s delivery
    - Version history feature implemented
    - Auto-saving partially implemented for surveys but not global
    - Max integrated into workflow and working on onboarding wizard
    - Branding elements for “bioptric survey” being added today

## Issues

1. Demo readiness concerns
    - Audrey to have a demo by the end of this week - needs a demoable-complete product
    - Decision needed: Friday demo vs Monday afternoon for more prep time
2. Interface inconsistencies requiring fixes
    - Mixed auto-save vs manual save behavior across sections
    - Modal vs slide-over approaches need standardization
    - Admin panel design: minimalistic vs blocked sidebar styling
    - Loading states showing “no surveys found” instead of “loading” message
3. Features to hide during demo
    - Hide branching logic page as it’s incomplete
    - Only show completed, usable features

## Next Steps

1. Demo preparation
    - Tai to rework the interface of the Surveys page
    - Thursday 2pm: Internal demo practice run
    - Hide incomplete features before external demo
2. Development decisions needed
    - Max to prepare onboarding wizard demo by EOD Friday
    - Establish global auto-save vs manual save approach
    - Standardize modal vs slide-over interface patterns
3. Post-demo priorities
    - Focus on “whole person safety” wizard integration
    - End-of-week call on existing structure accommodation
