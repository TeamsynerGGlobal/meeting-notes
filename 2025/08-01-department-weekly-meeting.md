## Updates

1. **Hiding Whole Person Safety question bank (400 questions) from end users**
    - Creating wizard within survey creation after marketplace purchase
    - Users select from 6 zones, minimum 2 indicators per zone
    - Deborah standardizing to 2-3 preset questions per indicator
    - Target range: 24-40 indicators (48-80 questions max)
2. **Demo for Audrey next week focusing on custom survey creation capabilities**
3. **Max pushed first repository update with toggleable onboarding system**
4. **Sisey tested Tailwind CSS but reverted due to poor marketplace card visuals**

## Issues

1. **Report generation complexity for Whole Person Safety**
    - Need automated PDF reports based on likert scale averages
    - Risk of AI-generated inappropriate recommendations for branded product
2. **Making Whole Person Safety accessible to average users in under 20 minutes**
    - 86 indicators across 22 standards across 6 safety zones
    - Challenge: HR managers/executives lack framework context
3. **Repository dependency problems preventing application startup**
    - Max required Node.js and Meteor version updates
    - Package file consistency needed across developers
4. **Wizard UI design challenges for presenting 86 indicators intuitively**
