## Issues

1. **Survey editing limitations**
  - Users can add and delete questions but cannot edit existing questions
  - Current workaround requires deleting and recreating questions
  - Identified as poor user experience that needs addressing
2. **Marketplace product update management**
  - Challenge of handling updates to purchased survey templates
  - Need to determine if updates automatically apply to existing user surveys or remain point-in-time
  - Considering WordPress plugin model: notify users of updates with changelog, let them choose whether to apply
  - Concerns about changing questions after responses collected (muddies data)
3. **Payment processing complexity for marketplace**
  - Questions about handling low-value transactions (99¢ items) versus processing fees
  - Need for minimum price thresholds for paid products
  - Additional terms of service requirements for monetary transactions
  - Banking and accounting complexities for small payments
4. **Survey template versus question bank focus**
  - Initial assumption that question banks would be sellable products
  - Realization that complete survey templates more valuable to purchasers
  - Target market willing to pay $1,000-$10,000 wants complete solutions, not assembly required
